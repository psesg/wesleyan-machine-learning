# Wesleyan machine learning
Jupyter notebooks and data from a [Machine Learning Coursera Class at Wesleyan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-data-analysis/)

For the last two assignments I converted the Jupyter notebooks to a markdown file which I could then easily copy into 
[my blog](www.radumas.info/blog) for submission in the class. The code to do this was:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown assignment.ipynb 
```
